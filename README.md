Mobile Orientation Scavenger Hunt - Web Service

---

**Note**: The following Visual Studio extensions *should* be installed, but isn't required (probably):

* [NuGet Package Manager](http://nuget.org/): Manages external dependencies (in our case, the [ServiceStack](http://servicestack.net/) Web Services framework)

* [JetBrains ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/): Definitely *not* required, but is extremely awesome and highly recommended
